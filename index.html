                    I am a full-stack senior software engineer with a cumulative total of 6 years of experience.
                    I have experience in large, complex enterprise domains as a salaried full-time developer. I also have experience contracting and freelancing independently.
                    In particular, most of my expertise is in .NET applications with React front-ends.  However, I have picked up other technologies such as Anglular and WPF with ease in order to deliver on smaller projects.
                    <br />
                    I have worked on data and integration heavy Service Oriented Architectures, as well as websites with beautiful front-ends designed by UX Design Specialists.

                <p class="blurb">
                    I returned to Entelect as a full-time Senior Engineer, based on an Anglo American project. I have worked on building major parts of a Service Oriented Architecture in Azure. This included the development using Azure Functions, App Services, Service Bus, Azure SQL and Azure IaC.
                    Additionally, the user-facing portions of the application were built using a vertical slice code layout with a CQRS pattern. The front-end was built in React and Material UI and needed to make use of Anglo's design system.
                    I additionally designed and implemented a GraphQL endpoint for fetching organisational data by multiple applications.
                    Due to application security requried in the SOA, I implemented several Azure authentication flows such as MSAL, On-Behalf Flow and Client Credentials Flow.
                    <br />
                    I supported the Technical Lead by making the smaller architectural decisions, and was responsible for providing oversight and mentorship to the other more junior developers on the team.

                    Responsible for leading the South African contingent of the development team, reporting to the Delivery Manager. This included mentoring juniors and intermediates, conducting interviews, and driving technical change. I also Career Managed two junior developers.
                    <br />
                    The project involved a large migration from angular.js (V1) to React while delivering features and maintenance in parallel.
                    I implemented measures to improve maintainability and efficiency. This included the migration of weakly typed Typescript to stronger typing rules and analysing and introducing strict linting rules to reduce bug counts coming back from QA.
                    I played a major role in driving this 11-man team to start adopting some SCRUM processes to improve planning and efficiency. Introducing this lead to clearer client excpectations and happier developers.

                Sub-contracted to migrate a 30 000+ line of code HT-BASIC application built in the 1970s to a modern desktop application. I rewrote the application in C# WPF. The application assisted engineers to design electric motors. Since this was a client I landed in my personal capacity, I performed requirements analysis, pipeline planning, prioritisation, development and testing. This was done on the side, after working hours. My main employer (Entelect, below) was aware that I had this project and was okay with this as my performance was solid.
