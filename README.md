# CV
I created an HTML & CSS version of my CV from scratch. The reason for this is because Word is not ideal for adjusting layouts. This was also an opportunity to sharpen my front-end clean code fundamentals.

## A4
The CV renders in the browser such it looks identical to how it would print on A4. Ctrl + P, Save As PDF, will give the same result.

todo:
Remove your personal profile. You can tell them these things in the interview

Change your education section to just list your degree if they want more details they'll ask about it.

In terms of work experience, tell me how you used the various technologies, you should have max 5 bullet points for a job role

A bullet point can be something like you "Designed a UI using Figma and then deployed to $ReactJS framework which was hosted on $some_azure_tech" (Purely an example sentence but demonstrates what you did vs name X tech)

Your technical skills lists various different technologies but I do not know how you used them and for all I know you just looked at a youtube tutorial. Make sure your interests/achievements showcase how you used them.

Format wise you should do the following:

Contact details top of the page

Education

Work experience

Projects

Use a CV generator like resumake.io it only generates one page and you can save it as json so you can modify it later

Edit: fix formatting
