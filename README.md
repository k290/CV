# CV
I created an HTML & CSS version of my CV from scratch. The reason for this is because I found it painful to adjust layouts in Word. This was also an opportunity to sharpen my front-end clean code fundamentals.
## A4
The CV renders in the browser such it looks identical to how it would print on A4. Ctrl + P, Save As PDF, will give the same result.
